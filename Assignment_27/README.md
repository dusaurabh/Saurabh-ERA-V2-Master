## This is ERA V2 Assignment 27

### In this assignment, we were told to implement Car simulation using our own custom environment using T3D ( TWIN-DELAYED DEEP DETERMINISTIC POLICY GRADIENT MODELS) 

### For this assignment, i have used London City Map. Created the map images for that enviornment and train my car simulation on it

## Check this Youtube video [Link](https://youtu.be/m79EIwVlWic?si=37L2x7qKQOdJ4LXc). Do check it out !!

### File contents

- car.kv -> Kivy file for setting up car
- ai.py -> model arhitecture of T3D
- map.py -> main file which call ai.py where we have defined our custom enviornment, rewards, etc
- images -> Here we have collected our custom enviornment images
    - citymap.png -> main image file of london city
    - mask.png -> mask object of the enviornment
    - car.png -> car photo which we are using in out simulation
