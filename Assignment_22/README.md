## This is ERA V2 Assignment 22 of Session 22
#### We were told to
Design a variation of a VAE that:

1) takes in two inputs:
  i) an MNIST image, and
  ii) its label (one hot encoded vector sent through an embedding layer)
2) Training as you would train a VAE
3) Now randomly send an MNIST image, but with a wrong label. Do this 25 times, and share what the VAE makes (25 images stacked in 1 image)!
4) Now do this for CIFAR10 and share 25 images (1 stacked image)!
5) Questions asked in the assignment are:
6) Share the MNIST notebook link ON GITHUB 
7) Share the CIFAR notebook link ON GITHUB 
8) Upload the 25 MNIST outputs PROPERLY labeled 
9) Upload the 25 CIFAR outputs PROPERLY labeled.
